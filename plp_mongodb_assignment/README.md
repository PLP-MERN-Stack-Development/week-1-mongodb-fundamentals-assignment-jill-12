üíª How the Assignment Was Completed

 Prerequisites

- MongoDB installed and running locally
- `mongosh` available (MongoDB shell)
- VS Code or any terminal environment


 Step 1: Insert Data Using `insert_books.js`

The `insert_books.js` file contains an array of book documents to be inserted into the `books` collection inside the `plp_bookstore` database.

To insert the data, the following commands were run in the terminal:

```bash
mongosh
then inside the mongosh shell: 
use plp_bookstore
load("insert_books.js")This command loads and executes the insert_books.js script, inserting the books into the collection.

After loading the data, the following command was used to view the inserted documents in a formatted manner:
db.books.find().pretty()



Run Queries

Open the queries.js file and manually copy-paste the queries into your MongoDB shell or Compass query tab.


The screenshot (screenshot.png) shows the books collection inside the plp_bookstore database with sample data.


 
 Notes

    Make sure MongoDB is running before executing the script.

    Your database name should be plp_bookstore.

    You can verify data using MongoDB Compass or Atlas.
